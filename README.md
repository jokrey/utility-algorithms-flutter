# jokrey_utilities

Utility algorithm in flutter.
Some of these algorithms and utilities might exist in a similar form in other repositories in other languages.
Notably this package currently contains a wrapper around the already quite good flutter-webrtc package.
Encapsulates some complicated network signaling stuff and provides a websocket wrapper to communicate with
   a generic go signaling server (found in another repository).
